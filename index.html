                <div class="course-overview">
                    <p>This course explores the role of artistic expression in Caribbean resistance movements from the late twentieth century through the twenty-first century. Grounded in the themes of anti-colonialism, cultural survival, and social transformation, the course explores how Caribbean artists have responded to and reshaped histories of colonization, slavery, racial hierarchy, and economic exploitation. Through an interdisciplinary lens, we will examine music, film, photography, and literature as not only aesthetic works but also as tools of resistance, documentation, and reimagination. The course will highlight how these artistic practices contributed to liberation efforts and examine the diverse imaginations of freedom they represent. These varied expressions of freedom will be explored as enduring echoes that resonate through time, demonstrating the ongoing impact of creative resistance on societal change.</p>
                    
                    <p>Drawing on case studies from across the Caribbean, including Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Trinindad, Antigua and St. Lucia, we will analyze how artistic practices articulate visions of justice, liberation, and self-determination. We will ask: How has music been used to voice the concerns of the marginalized, to narrate resistance, and to build community across divides? How do Caribbean filmmakers reclaim historical narratives and reframe present realities? What does it mean for photography to bear witness to injustice and survival? In what ways do Caribbean writers reconfigure language, memory, and identity to subvert colonial norms and imagine alternative futures?</p>
                    
                    <p>Each week will focus on a specific artistic medium and its relationship to a central theme in Caribbean resistance. Through close analysis of both primary artistic works and secondary critical texts, students will learn to understand artistic production as both historical archive and social intervention. We begin with music, examining reggae and calypso, as foundational forms of resistance to critique colonialism, capitalism, and state violence, while inspiring collective consciousness and action. In Week Two, we turn to photography as a visual archive and resistance tool. Through selected image collections, we will explore how photographers challenge exoticized portrayals of the Caribbean and instead document tourism, environmental destruction, identity, and social movements. Week Three explores Caribbean film as a medium of memory, resistance, and cultural critique. Films will be analyzed for how they represent colonial legacies, migration, racialized poverty, and political unrest. The final week centers on Caribbean literature—poetry, prose, and drama—as a vehicle of resistance and reclamation. We will examine how writers use language to confront histories of violence and imagine postcolonial futures.</p>
                    
                    <p>Assignments will include weekly short analytical reflections to connect creative works with their historical contexts. In-class group work will promote collaborative analysis and deepen engagement with both primary and secondary materials. Students will also complete a final essay or digital project on Caribbean resistance art.</p>

                    <p> Ultimately, this course asks students to consider the stakes of art in the context of struggle and freedom. Why does Caribbean art matter? What does it reveal about histories of oppression and resistance? How does it challenge dominant narratives, and what can it teach us about resilience, memory, and hope? By the end of the course, students will understand how Caribbean artists use creative expression to resist oppression, preserve culture, and reimagine the world. They will gain critical tools to interpret art as social intervention and cultural testimony, deepening their awareness of the Caribbean as a region forged through struggle and sustained through creativity. </p>
