            <h2>Literary Work</h2>
            <p>This week examines literature as a critical site of resistance in the Caribbean. Focusing on poetry, drama, and prose, we will explore how writers respond to histories of colonization, displacement, and power structures by crafting narratives that reclaim voice, identity, and agency. Literature in the Caribbean often bridges oral traditions, political critique, and experimental aesthetics, functioning both as a historical witness and a visionary tool for imagining alternative futures. We will analyze how Caribbean authors use language, genre, and form to interrogate imperialism, challenge systems of domination, resist cultural erasure, articulate visions of justice, liberation, and imagine alternative Caribbean futures.</p>

                    <li>Analyze how Caribbean literary texts resist colonialism, imperialism, and cultural erasure.</li>
                    <li>Explore the relationship between form, voice, and literary techniques in Caribbean writing.</li>
                    <li>Examine how literature constructs memory, identity, and collective resistance.</li>
                    <li>Compare how different genres (poetry, play, essay) articulate resistance, critique power, and engage audiences.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>What rhetorical or literary strategies (symbolism, voice, irony, structure) do the authors use to express collective resistance and reimagine historical narratives?</li>
                    <li>In what ways do genre and form amplify or constrain the message in each text?</li>

                <h3>In-Class Activity</h3>
                <ul>
                    Students will work in groups to perform a close reading of an assigned passage (from poetry, drama, or play). Each group will identify literary devices and analyze how these strategies express resistance, cultural identity, or critique of power. Presentations will link form to message, reinforcing literature’s resistive and imaginative power.

                            <p>This poem describes the oppression, sorrow, and fear Guyana faces during the US intervention, highlighting themes of colonialism, oppression and cultural exploitation. It utilizes different literary devices and techniques like metaphor, personification and juxtaposition. It highlights the pervasive American cultural and political influence on the West Indies and serves as a significant piece of social commentary on power dynamics and marginalization. </p>

                            <p>This poem delves into the intricate and often fraught relationship between Puerto and the United States, focusing on the experiences of Puerto Rico encountering the U.S. Through vivid imagery and sharp contrasts, the poem critiques the idealized American dream versus the often harsh realities of racism, discrimination, and socio-economic inequality faced by Caribbean people. It highlights the pervasive American cultural and political influence on the West Indies and serves as a significant piece of social commentary on power dynamics and marginalization.</p>

                            <p>This book offers a scathing critique of an Antiguan native, intertwining personal memories with a sharp analysis of its socio-political landscape. The book highlights the enduring negative impacts of British colonialism, a corrupt and ineffective government prioritizing tourism over its citizens, and the detrimental effects of the tourist industry itself, which she argues exacerbates poverty and inequality. Ultimately, the book presents an unflinching examination of how Antigua's problems are deeply rooted in its colonial past and the ongoing exploitation of its people and resources.</p>

The source expresses challenges of the West Indies as former colonial territories that still struggle to achieve political independence and forge a proud national identity based on love and a positive perception. </p>
