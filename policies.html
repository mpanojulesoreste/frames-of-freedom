                <p>Students are highly encouraged to attend all lectures to not only get the most of the course, but to also prepare for how to tackle weekly writing assignments and the final. While attendance is not recorded in lecture, students will be graded on their participation in lecture. Participation goes beyond showing up to class. Students are to critically engage with course materials and lecture presentations conducted by the instructor. Think of this course as a non-traditional lecture.</p>
                
                <p>Successful weekly writing assignments go beyond summarizing texts. Students should practice close-reading of primary sources and asking necessary questions surrounding the historical time period in which these texts were written, why they were written, how they were written, and the arguments that are being proposed.</p>
                
                <p>The final assignment is a major portion of your grade. While students can choose between the creative project or the comparative essay, students are highly encouraged to begin thinking about how they will approach the assignment two weeks before the due date. Please meet with course instructors in office hours with an outline before submission.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Attendance of Caribbean public events on campus during the semester can earn you extra credit.</p>

                    <h4>AI Usage Policy</h4>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, this course draws on the intellectual and artistic work of authors who have been interrogating and exploring visions of freedom in the Caribbean as well as modes of resistance. I trust that students will rely on their abilities to intellectually and critically engage with these texts. While the use of AI generated software is not entirely prohibited in this course, students are not allowed to use such software for weekly writing assignments and the final.</p>
                    
                    <p>If students need more clarity on texts, resources like office hours and writing resources on campus are highly encouraged. AI generated software such as ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot should only be used for brief summaries and/or historical context(s). Other AI generated software such as NotebookLM is strictly prohibited.</p>
                    
                    <p>Students who are found to have used this software will be penalized by the Honor Code Committee. Students who have used permissible AI generated software as stated above for writing assignments, and more specifically, for forming thesis arguments, will also be penalized by the Honor Code Committee.</p>
