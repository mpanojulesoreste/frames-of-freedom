            <h2>Cinematic Revolt: Film and the Caribbean Imagination</h2>
            <p>This week explores how Caribbean cinema functions as a powerful medium of cultural resistance, memory work, and political intervention. Caribbean filmmakers have long used the screen to critique colonial legacies, economic exploitation, migration, and political violence—foregrounding stories often silenced or distorted in dominant narratives. By centering marginalized voices, reclaiming historical memory, and envisioning liberatory futures, Caribbean films do more than represent—they resist, subvert, and reimagine.</p>

                <ul>
                    In small groups, students will analyze a selected film scene or sequence. Each group will examine and present how sound, cinematography, narrative, and historical context work together to construct resistance and survival of Caribbean people as well as critique structures of power.

As Xavier works to buy a new house, ironically dismantling his own vibrant neighborhood brick by brick, the film explores immigrant family dynamics, the looming threat of gentrification, and the complex pursuit of the American dream.</p>

                            <p>This film portrays the entrenched conflict central to Jamaican politics. This conflict has been globally visible through violent news imagery and headlines, particularly surrounding the manhunt for Christopher "Dudus" Coke, which resulted in numerous civilian deaths and a State of Emergency. In a timely manner, the production delves into the historical use of street gangs by political parties as a tool in their aggressive campaigns to win national elections.</p>

                            <h4>Directed by Rosa Emmanuelli Gutiérrez and Gonzalo Mazzini </h4>
                            <p>This film documents Puerto Rico's enduring struggle against colonialism, first under Spanish rule and subsequently as a territory of the United States. Despite attempts by colonizers to erase their identity, Puerto Ricans have steadfastly resisted. The film brings together 41 diverse voices—professors, politicians, activists, and artists—to share this often untold story, offering a deep exploration of the island's colonial status, its people's dignity, and their ongoing pursuit of justice.</p>

                            <p>This source discusses the complexities of defining "Caribbean film," noting that filmmaking's collaborative nature often involves diverse international talent, making national or regional affiliation difficult. The essay aims to explore different conceptions of the Caribbean through selected films, examining how filmmakers, including those working "ex-isles" or between spaces, construct identity and engage with place in their art, particularly in reclaiming representation from colonial and other dominant filmmaking traditions.</p>

                            <p>This source posits that defining Caribbean cinema is challenging because it first requires defining "the Caribbean" itself, an identity shaped by colonial and post-colonial experiences leading to uncertain self-perception. It suggests considering "the Caribbean in cinema" before "Caribbean cinema" due to the relative newness of filmmaking by Caribbean people, emphasizing cinema's importance in establishing a nation's existence. </p>

                            <p>This source argues that while cinema offers opportunities for marginalized voices, it often presents a stereotyped and objectified image of the Caribbean, perpetuated by mainstream media. However, vibrant local film productions exist, aiming to capture an authentic, alternative Caribbean reflecting diverse lived experiences. The study focuses on Francophone Caribbean films defined as Creole cinema, demonstrating how they offer complex, nuanced depictions of marginalized cultures and intervene in postcolonial representations of nation, memory, and identity, addressing a neglected area within Francophone Cinema Studies. </p>

                            <p>This source investigates depictions of resistance in feature films by professionals from or of French Caribbean origin, aiming for an insider's perspective on these societies. It seeks to establish the existence of a distinct French Caribbean cinema based on shared thematic, dramatic, or aesthetic traits.  </p>

                <h3>Weekly Writing Assignment</h3>
                <ul>
                    Write a 1-2 page, double-spaced discussion post responding to the following: Choose one of the films assigned this week and analyze how it confronts systems of oppression or engages questions of identity and liberation. Focus on specific cinematic techniques (e.g., sound, mise-en-scène, editing, narrative structure) and explain how they support the film’s political or social message. Additionally, briefly mention how a secondary source expands, contextualizes or complicates the film.
