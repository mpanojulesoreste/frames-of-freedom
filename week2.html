            <h2>Shuttered Truths: Photography as Resistance and Reimagination in the Caribbean</h2>
            <p>This week examines photography as a powerful artistic and political medium through which Caribbean artists resist dominant narratives, document injustice, and assert alternative visions of identity, history, and community. Photography in the Caribbean becomes a mode of intervention—bearing witness to colonial violence, racial hierarchy, environmental degradation, and the tourist gaze, while also offering counter-archives of survival, resistance, and self-determination. We will explore how Caribbean photographers subvert exoticized imagery to produce new ways of seeing that foreground local agency, memory, and freedom struggles. Through both historical and contemporary photographic collections, we will ask: What does it mean to “see” the Caribbean and how can we  imagine a different future?</p>

                <ul>
                    Students will collaboratively analyze selected photographs in small groups. Each group will present a short interpretation focusing on: how the photograph resists or reconfigures dominant narratives, the visual techniques and symbolism used and how each photograph connects to themes such as environmental justice, colonial legacies, racial hierarchies, state violence, and economic exploitation,  or cultural memory.

                            <p>This source examines culture, politics, religion, and tourism in the Caribbean over the past century through a collection of compelling images. This deluxe volume explores the multifaceted image and complex identity of the Caribbean, shaped by both Western perceptions and its own diverse population—a result of the 400-year slave trade involving Africans, indigenous peoples, and various European colonizers. Featuring hundreds of photographs spanning a century, it documents Caribbean history, culture, industry, and the diaspora of its people.</p>

                            <h4>Marina Reyes Franco, Americas Society, and Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Puerto Rico. </h4>
                            <p>This source introduces the art exhibition "Tropical is Political: Caribbean Art Under the Visitor Economy Regime," a collaboration between Americas Society and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Puerto Rico (MAC). The exhibition features Caribbean artists investigating concepts of "paradise" and their connection to the region's tourism-driven economy, often referred to as the "visitor economy regime." It explores how this regime, a legacy of colonial plantation economies, impacts cultural production, self-representation, land rights, and national identity across the Caribbean, focusing on themes of the body, territory, and finance.</p>

                            <p>This source examines photography's role in shaping social order in the age of social media, offering a sociological framework to study this transformation. Using actor-network theory, it analyzes not just images, but also the rituals, devices, networks, conversations, and regulations surrounding photography in the context of globalization and mobile technology. Photography is also seen as a complex social phenomenon capable of producing tangible change, moving beyond its perception as mere visual representation. </p>

                            <p>This source emphasizes how photographs integrate history and illuminate how past experiences shape present understanding. It argues that resistance reflects political, economic, and cultural forces, upsetting established patterns of thinking about power, gender, and race. Through their struggles and complexities, characters in photographs challenge conventional narratives of defiance, prompting a re-evaluation of what it means to resist and find meaning in the world.</p>

                            <p>This source discusses the symbolic Caribbean figure as a complex entity formed from multiple embodied subjectivities, with her image created from the intersection of audiovisual documentation, postcolonial narratives, and fiction. The source explores the ontology of Caribbean creole theories, which have been used to counter colonial narratives and assert a post-independent identity rooted in mixed-race heritage and hybrid new nations.  </p>

                            <p>This source reveals that the idyllic images of Jamaica and the Bahamas as tropical paradises were carefully crafted representations by promoters and colonial administrators commissioned. These "tropicalizing images," circulated internationally, not only shaped external perceptions but also altered life on the islands, influencing landscapes and restricting access for local black populations. This source analyzes the aesthetics of these historical images and their deviation from picturesque traditions, while also examining how contemporary artists deconstruct these tropes, even as postcolonial governments continue to use them for tourism. </p>

                    Write a 1-2 page, double-spaced discussion post responding to the following: How do the photographs you studied reflect themes of resistance, identity, and transformation? How do these photographs engage with historical narratives of colonialism, independence and social change? In what ways do these images confront colonial or commercial portrayals of the Caribbean? Also write a few lines about two secondary sources and how it contextualizes the primary source. Briefly analyze two secondary sources and how they help contextualize one or more of the primary images in terms of history, and representation.
